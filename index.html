                <!--All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat.-->

                <!--Now you will add a web form to collect information from users.-->
                <!--The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.-->
                <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
                    <!--The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.-->
                    <!--There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.-->
                    <!--In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.-->
                    <!--Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.-->
                    <!--To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.-->
                    <!--You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.Here is an example of a radio button with the option of cat: <input type="radio"> cat. Remember that input elements are self-closing.-->
                    <!--label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.-->
                    
                    <!--Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.-->
                    <!--The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.-->
                    <!--The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.-->

                    <!--In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute.

                    <!--Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.-->
